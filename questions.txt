1.Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.
 -A relational database is a type of database. It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables.
 -SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to communicate with data stored in a relational database management system. SQL syntax is similar to the English language, which makes it relatively easy to write, read, and interpret.

2.Why do tables need a primary key?
 - A primary key is a table column that serves a special purpose. Each database table needs a primary key because it ensures row-level accessibility.

3.What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
 -Foreign key

4.What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.
 -the middle table that joins everything "red box"
